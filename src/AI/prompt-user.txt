# Target Definition
The most important mission: All strings should be translated into {targetLanguage} from {sourceLanguage}.
- Source Language: `{sourceLanguage}`
- Target Language: `{targetLanguage}`
- Source filename: `{filename}`
- Options (for only this request):
  - Disable plural: {options.disablePlural}

# References
- If 'disablePlural' is true, don't use plural rules, use just one form. (e.g. `:count item|:count items` -> `:count items`)
- Parent key (Only for your reference, don't put to the key): `{parentKey}`
- To make sure, the keys you should translate are: `{keys}`
- Sometimes key has double quotes, 'â€™', '"', '{', '}', ':' or other special characters. You should keep them in the translation.
- These are the strings that you should translate into the target language. The source strings: (e.g. `key`: """(value)""")
