You are an expert in Laravel, PHP. This project is my blog project.

- Always print logs, messages in English. This is a laravel package for English people.
- Write the code shorter, and less complex as much as possible. Don't need to do over-engineering.

## PHP/Laravel
- This project strictly uses PHP 8.0. You MUST utilize all PHP 8.0 features for optimal and concise code. Features from PHP 8.1 and above are STRICTLY PROHIBITED:
  - Required PHP 8.0 Features (USE THESE):
    - **Match Expression**: Always prefer match over switch. Example: `match($status) { 200 => 'OK', 404 => 'Not Found', default => 'Unknown' };`
    - **Named Arguments**: Use for better readability. Example: `function greet(string $name, int $age) { ... } greet(age: 30, name: 'Alice');`
    - **Union Types**: Always use for flexible typing. Example: `function process(int|float $value): int|float { return $value * 2; }`
    - **Constructor Property Promotion**: Required for all new classes. Example: `class User { public function __construct(private string $name, private int $age) {} }`. Note: `readonly` properties are NOT supported in PHP 8.0, use only `public`, `protected`, or `private`.
    - **Attributes**: Use for metadata. Example: `#[ExampleAttribute] class MyClass { ... }`
    - **Nullsafe Operator**: Required for all nullable chains. Example: `$username = $user?->getProfile()?->getUsername();`
    - **String Functions**: Always use new string functions. Example: `str_contains()`, `str_starts_with()`, `str_ends_with()`
  - PROHIBITED Features (DO NOT USE):
    - PHP 8.1: Enums, Readonly Properties, First-class Callable Syntax, Pure Intersection Types, Never Return Type
    - PHP 8.2: Readonly Classes, DNF Types, Null/False Standalone Types
    - PHP 8.3: Typed Class Constants, #[\Override], Anonymous readonly classes
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
- Utilize Laravel's built-in features and helpers when possible.
- File structure: Follow Laravel's directory structure and naming conventions.
- Implement proper error handling and logging:
  - Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features.
  - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
  - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
- Use Laravel's validation features for form and request validation.
- Implement middleware for request filtering and modification.
- Utilize Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
- Use Laravel's query builder for complex database queries.
- Implement proper database migrations and seeders.
- Don't need to use interface for single implementation.
- Always define route names for each route. Use that on everywhere including inertia (tsx) links.
- For better performance in database, don't create foreign key relations. But consider creating indexes for columns that are frequently used in where clauses.
- I hate sprintf(). Please use "{$variable}" (not ${variable}) for string interpolation.
- When you make new migration file, use `php artisan make:migration create_table_name_table` command first before ccoding the Schema.
- When you code scheduled task, use the file 'console.php' instead of 'Kernel.php'.
- Never put two classes in a single file. Every php files should be only one single class.
- When creating classes and methods, always add comments describing their purpose and objectives. This helps AI better understand and respect the intended functionality during development. Example:
  ```php
  /**
   * Purpose: Handles user authentication and authorization
   * Objectives:
   * - Manage user login/logout process
   * - Handle session management
   * - Implement role-based access control
   */
  class AuthenticationService { ... }

  /**
   * Purpose: Validates user credentials against database
   * Objectives:
   * - Check if user exists
   * - Verify password hash
   * - Return authentication result
   */
  public function validateCredentials(array $credentials): bool { ... }
  ```

Dependencies
- Laravel 10
- Composer for dependency management
